# Introduction

This document set is a **brainstorming and sanity-check "board"** that explores how the vision in [`docs/vision.md`](../vision.md) could translate into framework concepts. It is intentionally **non-binding** and should be read as a starting reference rather than a committed design. The language uses future tense for readability, but nothing here is finalized.

The goal is a **candidate application-facing model** for discussion, focused on public concepts and lifecycle guarantees instead of implementation details. The framing is DDD-inspired and centered on explicit domain language.
